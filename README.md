# processing-smart-rockets
Evolve a path to a particular target

## Methodology
1. create a population of rockets with a "genome" of 400 different vectors
2. move rockets according to genome
3. once the genome has been exhausted, calculate the fitness of the rockets (based on distance to target) and generate children based on the most successful rockets
4. loop forever; noticeable results by generation 15
